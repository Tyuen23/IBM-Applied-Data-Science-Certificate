Introduction/Business Problem: 
  Currently due to Covid-19 many restaurants and stores (regardless of size) have suffered major financial losses due to
  restrictions placed on the community to stay inside and be safe. Moreover, large franchises and chains are looking to close down
  some of their stores to cope for the losses. Starbucks recently announced that they will potentially close up to 200 stores 
  across Canada. Although they have recently begun to reopen their stores Starbucks is still pressing forward with this plan and closely
  monitoring their businesses. As a result, this project will look at which stores should Starbucks close. As I live near the Toronto area,
  I will be focusing my analysis within that geographical location.
  
  The criteria will be based on:
    1. Population density of each neighbourhood
    2. Average age of the neighbourhood looking for (20s - 50s)
    3. Median Salary 
    4. Amount of competitors nearby (Coffee Shops tagged by Foursquare API)
    
   With these criteria in place we will look to analyze which shops should Starbucks close for cost efficiency purposes.

Data:
  The necessary data will come from several websites such as:
   City of Toronto Neighbourhood Profiles:
   https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/neighbourhoods-communities/neighbourhood-profiles/
   
   Wikipedia for Toronto Boroughs:
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_city-designated_neighbourhoods_in_Toronto
   
   Foursquare API:
   https://developer.foursquare.com
   
   The neighbourhood profiles will provide us the demographic details for the criteria to be assessed. Wikipedia will allow for 
   the neighbourhood details to be clustered into a map. Foursquare API will allow us to locate where the Starbucks are in Toronto and 
   general competitors.
